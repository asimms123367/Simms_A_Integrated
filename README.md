# Final Integrated Project

# ABOUT
The final integrated project (FIP) is a combination of all my core courses combined for submission. In this project there is a combination of use of colour, logo design, site layout and design, typography, alignment, photograhy and optimization for the web.

# IDEA SURROUNDING MY WEBSITE
My website is focused on my new hobby which is mobile photography. The site showcases photos as part of the requirements of some of my photographs but also all photos that I have takeb using my mobile device. The site also focuses on primarily indoor photography as the images highlight my time in quarantine in London, Canada.

# THEME/BREAKDOWN
The website's home page and logo was carefully thought out to refelect my home country - Jamaica. The logo was designed using the colours of the Jamaican flag - black, green and gold. The general concept is showing a laid back font style, indicative of the Jamaican lifestyle. The logo shows a mobile device illustrating the focus of the site on mobile photography.

The site also the same colour scheme across all pages. The navigation links, submission button, top bar, key words and focus box around the social media icon all have a green colour scheme. The text to the paragraphs are black and the hero image is a bright yellow flower - all to depict the Jamaican colours. The home page is also has bright colours reflecting the look and feel of Jamaica which is sunny and bright almost year round.

When you get to the gallery and contact page, the images reflect a change. It illustrates being in a new country but primarily in quarantine. I try to highlight the boots and coat which are essential after getting out of quarantine but a stark contrast to Jamaican attire. Other images reflected showing brands that are not Jamaican and also highlights essential items in quarantine such as food items, snacks, fruits, toys for my son, a heater for the cold and essentials such as sanitizer and mask.  There are images showing my time during quarantine that I am still focused on my studies, showing the Fanshawe College page as well as the course container page - one image with my snacks at night to do work and another in the daytime with headphone to reflect classtime. There are also two (2) images showing a look from inside the room looking out from different angles and perspectives.

The images were deliberately taken in low light conditions again to illustrate my time indoors and in quarantine.
